## Introduction

This project is designed to showcase various GitHub Actions workflows including continuous integration (CI) and deployment to GitHub Pages. 

## Workflows

### CI Workflow

The CI workflow runs on every push and pull request to the `main` branch. It sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, and runs tests to ensure the code is working as expected.

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
main
